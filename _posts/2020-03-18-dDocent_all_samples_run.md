All sample files were copied here including technical reps. dDocent was run with trimming, mapping and SNP calling and no assembly. K1 = 5, K2 =2 and %similarity = 0.9. Reference.fasta from round2 of dDocent run was also copied here as reference. Parameters of the run can be found in config.file in the same dir.
